Why is a tree appropriate for the doctor structure?
    A tree is appropriate for the doctor reporting structure because it naturally represents
    hierarchical relationships. Each node corresponds to a doctor, and child nodes represent direct 
    reports. This structure makes it easy to visualize subordinates analyze management levels,like we have 
    done in this assignment.A tree is different to a simple array or a list because it allows 
    efficient traversal of individual branches and the entire hierarchy.

When might a software engineer use preorder, inorder, or postorder traversals?
    Software engineers might use different tree traversals depending on the task. Preorder
    traversal visits a node before its children, which is useful when generating reports 
    that include managers before their subordinates. Inorder traversal processes the left 
    subtree, then the node, then the right subtree; in a binary search tree, this results 
    in sorted data, useful for alphabetically or numerically ordered reports. Postorder 
    traversal visits children before the node, which is helpful when making changes upward in a hierarchy.

How do heaps help simulate real-time systems like emergency intake?
    Heaps are particularly useful for simulating real-time systems like emergency patient intake. 
    A min-heap allows the system to always access the patient with the highest urgency efficiently. 
    When new patients arrive or are treated, the heap can quickly reorder itself to maintain priority order. 
    This ensures that critical patients are served first, mimicking real-world triage in hospitals. 
    Compared to other data structures, heaps provide a balance between fast insertion and removal while
    maintaining priority, which is essential for responsive and fair emergency system management.
